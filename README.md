## Inspiration

Hungry Hungry Hippos was a major source of inspiration. We all also wanted to try game development and learn something new.

## What it does

BrickSnack allows four players to munch bricks for points, in a similar format to Hungry Hungry Hippos.

## How we built it

We built it using Phaser on a Rails server to allow for multiplayer action. The art for the game was made using Figma. 

## Challenges we ran into

Phaser proved to be incredibly finicky and it kept us behind for hours. Identical code to Phaser demos would produce different results for us. We also had a small team and that made it 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

Creating our first game!

## What we learned

The basics of game development. It was eye-opening to see how much work goes into making even a simple game (in less than 24 hours).

## What's next for BrickSnack

BrickSnack can be expanded to allow for more players to play against each other in a battle royale. Furthermore, BrickSnack can be re-envisioned as a platform game, in which hippos traverse the menacing RIT savanna to eat bricks to their hearts content.
